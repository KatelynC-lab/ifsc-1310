                <h1>Description of Minecraft</h1>
                <p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox adventure game developed by Mojang Studios where players can interact with a fully customizable three-dimensional world made of blocks and entities. Its diverse gameplay options allow players to choose the way they play, creating countless possibilities.</p>
                <p>There are three actively maintained editions of Minecraft: Java Edition (Windows, macOS, Linux); Bedrock Edition (Windows, mobile, and consoles); and Minecraft Education (for educational settings). There is also a localized release of the game for mainland China.</p>

                <h2>Trading</h2>
                <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                <p>Pressing use on an adult villager with a profession, or on a wandering trader, opens a menu, allowing a player to trade with the villager or wandering trader. This action pauses any pathfinding the entity was doing. If the entity takes damage while trading, the trading menu closes. The same thing happens if they walk or are transported far enough away.</p>
                <p>All transactions involve emeralds. Villagers buy or sell goods for emeralds, and wandering traders sell items for emeralds but do not buy items (unless the villager trade rebalance experiment is enabled). Trading is the only legitimate method of acquiring the globe banner pattern, woodland explorer maps, trial explorer maps and ocean explorer maps in Survival mode. It is also the only renewable way to obtain bells, diamond gear[note 1], lapis lazuli‌[BE only], bottles o' enchanting, glass, sand, red sand, coral blocks and small dripleaves.</p>
                <h3>Level</h3>
                <p>Villagers have five career levels that can be increased by trading with them. Each villager starts at the <q>novice</q> level. A villager's level can be seen in the trading menu. The badge they wear can also be identified: stone for a novice, iron for an apprentice, gold for a journeyman, emerald for an expert, and diamond for a master. Trading until the villager's trading bar gets full unlocks the next level of trades. When a player trades with a villager, both the villager and the player gain experience. All villager trades reward the player with 3–6 experience, plus an additional 5 experience if the villager levels up due to the trade. Trading with a wandering trader also rewards the player with some experience, although the trader does not have experience levels to gain. A villager levels up when its experience bar becomes full and gains up to two new trades, along with keeping their old ones. Additionally, a villager receives a Regeneration effect, and becomes surrounded by purple and green particles for ten seconds.</p>
                <p>Trades from the Master level would still reward the villager with experience, but it has no actual effect as the villager can't level up any further.</p>

                </table>
                <p>In Java Edition, villagers have a maximum of 10 trades. Each level unlocks a maximum of two new trades. If a level has a pool of more than two trades, the two offered trades are chosen randomly from the set.</p>
                <p>In Bedrock Edition, villagers have 7–10 trade slots. A slot with multiple possible trades will display only one trade; for example, farmer villagers have 4 potential trades in their first trade slot, so each trade has a 1⁄4 chance to be chosen.</p>
                <p>A villager's profession dictates the trading pool used to determine its trades. For example, villagers wearing straw hats are farmers, so their trades are based on the Farmer trade pool. Each profession unlocks a pre-defined and finite set of offers. Different professions are assigned to each villager based on their job-site block. This profession is indicated by their appearance and in the trading interface. Novice villagers who have not traded can lose their profession and change back into unemployed villagers if their claimed job site block is removed. Removing and then replacing a job site block can alter the trades offered, and a villager with no experience resets its trades every so often. Once a player trades with a villager, the villager keeps its profession forever and subsequently locks in the offered trades.</p>
